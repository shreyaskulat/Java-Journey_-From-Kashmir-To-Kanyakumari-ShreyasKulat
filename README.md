Certainly! It looks like you want a Java program that includes a list of cities from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and then prints them line by line. Here's a simple Java program to accomplish this:
public class CitiesList {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // List of cities from Kashmir to Kanyakumari
        String[] cities = {
            "Srinagar", "Jammu", "Ludhiana", "Delhi", "Jaipur", "Ahmedabad", 
            "Mumbai", "Bangalore", "Chennai", "Kanyakumari"
        };
        
        // Print cities line by line
        System.out.println("Cities from Kashmir to Kanyakumari:");
        for (String city : cities) {
            System.out.println(city);
        }
    }
}
In this program, we have an array cities that contains the names of cities from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. The program then iterates through the array using a for-each loop and prints each city name on a new line.

When you run this program, it will output:

Cities from Kashmir to Kanyakumari:
Srinagar
Jammu
Ludhiana
Delhi
Jaipur
Ahmedabad
Mumbai
Bangalore
Chennai
Kanyakumari
